Description: Adoptadog is an html site with CSS and Javascript/JQuery support. It is a commercial site used primarily for the adoption of dogs.
It is designed with both the PC, the tablet and mobile devices in mind. It is of simple design so that more service options such as links to kennel societies and veterinary advice can be added as the business grows and it's needs change.
It is also designed to be a place where doglovers and dog's in need of rescuing can be easily united - the process streamlined even for the busiest professional or parent (or both) can quickly compare and make decisions.
This is a secondary support for the National PAWs foundation.
